# sgrom-solemnizer-list-extractor
A simple program to pull ROM solemnizer list.

This script is provided as is without any warranty/support etc...

Requires Python3 to run.

Just run the batch files required.

It will basically go to the public ROM page for licensed solemnizers and parse it into CSV format. 

Hopefully this can save time for those looking for solemnizers by name.
